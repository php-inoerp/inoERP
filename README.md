inoERP is an open-source **[OneApp](https://docs.rikdata.com)** (GoLang back-end & Flutter front-end) based enterprise management system. The ERP systems contain all the required modules for running any small to midsize business. The features are very similar to Oracle R12/ Cloud Application and SAP ECC/Hana S/4. It also contains a lightweight CMS which seamlessly integrates with the ERP.
